            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at SUNY New Paltz. I received my high school diploma from Waldwick High School in New Jersey and received my Associate's Degree in Computer Science from Orange County Community College in the Spring of 2021.
            </p>
            <p>I took my first web development class in my Senior year of high school in 2017 and knew that I wanted to pursue a career involving programming right away. While I initially struggled to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in class, over years of practice the concepts have become much more natural to me and I have picked up many new languages and frameworks from the courses I have taken as part of my Computer Science degree, as well as from my own personal projects and several freelance projects for friends and family.</p>
            <p>I believe that this diverse range of experience has enabled me to take on a wide range of different programming projects. I look forward to learning about any projects that you would like to take on and working with you to implement your solution!</p>
